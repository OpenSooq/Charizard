## Getting Started
### Installing steps

* Install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/download/) and [mongoDb](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
* create a new charizard db in mongo with two collections :
  * page with unique index on name attribute.
  * page_log with index on page_id attribute.
* Create new directory for your charizard and navigate to it, clone the repo and run the `npm install` command:
  
  ```bash
    $ npm install
  ```

* add the following command to your [cron job](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-do-i-add-jobs-to-cron-under-linux-or-unix-oses/) list to be running every day to fetch the page load speed results for your urls:
  ```bash
    $ npm run cron 
  ```
  
* create .env file and add to it the environment variables if you want to override the defaults ones that set in proj.js file.
  
* to start the porject run web command: 
  ```bash
    $ npm run web 
  ```  

* By following above steps you will be running your own charizard. If any of these steps do not work for you, please report this as issue on this github repository and we will look into it as soon as possible!
